Sync and Login Workflows
**Work in Progress**


Upload Sync

1. Whenever data of any kind is saved to offline DB, add a JSON string to sync queue (probably a database).
{ 'type' : 'type_goes_here', 'parameters' : { 'parameter_1' : 'value_1', 'parameter_2' : 'value_2' } }

2. After adding data to the sync queue, (if internet exists) attempt to process the sync queue asynchronously using AJAX.
Every item gets it's own request and corresponding callback function (see #3).

3. If a response of { 'type' : 'type_goes_here', 'result' : '', 'success' : true } is returned:
Delete the original sync request from the sync queue and continue.

4. Otherwise the item will remain in the sync queue, and the server will ideally return something like:
{ 'type' : 'type_goes_here', 'result' : 'error_message_goes_here', 'success' : false }


Login

1. User opens Tennote. They are presented with a login screen and a link to register.

2. If they click on register, they fill out credentials (user/pass/email) which are all required.

	- If internet exists: Send register request to server (through sync queue?), if successful, 
	then return user to login page with message, otherwise print error message (e.g. user already in use)
	Then add user to local database
	
	- If internet doesn't exist:
